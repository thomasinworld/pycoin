## 📚 How It Works

### 1. Cryptographic Keys & Addresses

**Concept**: Every wallet needs a private key (secret) and public key (shareable).

```python
# Generate a new wallet
from core import Wallet

wallet = Wallet()
print(f"Address: {wallet.address}")
print(f"Private Key: {wallet.private_key.to_hex()}")
```

**What's Happening**:
1. **Private Key**: Random 256-bit number (your secret!)
2. **Public Key**: Derived from private key using ECDSA elliptic curve
3. **Address**: Hash of public key, Base58Check encoded

**Why It Matters**: 
- Private key = ownership (keep it secret!)
- Public key = verification
- Address = easy-to-share identifier

---

### 2. Transactions

**Concept**: Transfer value from one address to another with cryptographic proof.

```python
# Alice sends 5 PYC to Bob
transaction = alice.send(blockchain, bob.address, 5.0)
```

**Transaction Structure**:
```
Transaction
├── Inputs (spending previous outputs)
│   └── Reference to previous transaction + signature
├── Outputs (creating new outputs)
│   ├── Recipient address + amount
│   └── Change address + remaining amount
└── Signatures (proving ownership)
```

**UTXO Model** (Unspent Transaction Outputs):
- Unlike bank accounts, crypto uses "coins" that can be spent
- Each transaction spends entire UTXOs and creates new ones
- Like spending a $20 bill and getting change

**Example**:
```
Alice has: 20 PYC (from previous transaction)
Alice sends Bob: 5 PYC

Input:  [20 PYC from TX#123]
Output: [5 PYC to Bob] + [14.999 PYC back to Alice] + [0.001 fee]
```

---

### 3. Mining & Proof of Work

**Concept**: Secure the network by solving computational puzzles.

```python
# Mine a block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions(miner.address)
```

**What's Happening**:
1. Collect pending transactions
2. Create block header with:
   - Previous block hash
   - Merkle root of transactions
   - Timestamp
   - Difficulty target
   - **Nonce** (number you're trying to find)
3. Hash the header repeatedly, changing nonce each time
4. Find a hash that starts with N zeros (e.g., `0000abcd...`)
5. First miner to find valid nonce wins the block reward!

**Why Proof of Work?**
- Makes it expensive to attack the network
- Creates consensus without central authority
- Secures transaction history

**Difficulty Example**:
```
Difficulty 1: Hash must start with 0
Difficulty 4: Hash must start with 0000
Difficulty 10: Hash must start with 0000000000

Higher difficulty = More attempts needed = More secure
```

---

### 4. The Blockchain

**Concept**: Chain of blocks, each linked to the previous one.

```
Block #0 (Genesis)
  Hash: 0000abc123...
  Previous: 0000000000...
  Transactions: [Coinbase → Miner: 50 PYC]
         ↓
Block #1
  Hash: 0000def456...
  Previous: 0000abc123...  ← Links to Block #0
  Transactions: [Alice → Bob: 5 PYC, ...]
         ↓
Block #2
  Hash: 0000ghi789...
  Previous: 0000def456...  ← Links to Block #1
  Transactions: [...]
```

**Why Chains Are Secure**:
- Each block contains hash of previous block
- Changing any block changes its hash
- This breaks the chain for all subsequent blocks
- Would need to re-mine entire chain (computationally infeasible!)

---

### 5. Supply Cap & Halving

**Concept**: Limit total supply like Bitcoin (21 million coins).

```python
def get_block_reward(block_height):
    halvings = block_height // 210000
    return 50_00000000 >> halvings  # Halve reward
```

**Halving Schedule**:
```
Blocks 0 - 209,999:         50 PYC per block
Blocks 210,000 - 419,999:   25 PYC per block
Blocks 420,000 - 629,999:   12.5 PYC per block
Blocks 630,000 - 839,999:   6.25 PYC per block
...
After ~64 halvings:         0 PYC (all mined)
```

**Total Supply**:
```
210,000 × 50 = 10,500,000 PYC
210,000 × 25 = 5,250,000 PYC
210,000 × 12.5 = 2,625,000 PYC
...
Total ≈ 21,000,000 PYC
```

### File Responsibilities

#### `crypto.py` - Cryptographic Building Blocks
```python
# Hash functions
sha256(data)           # Single SHA-256 hash
double_sha256(data)    # SHA-256(SHA-256(data)) - used in Bitcoin
hash160(data)          # RIPEMD160(SHA-256(data)) - for addresses

# Encoding
base58_encode(data)    # Human-friendly encoding
base58check_encode()   # With checksum (for addresses)
```

**Why These Functions?**
- **SHA-256**: Cryptographic hash (one-way, collision-resistant)
- **Double SHA-256**: Extra security layer
- **RIPEMD-160**: Shorter hash for addresses
- **Base58**: Like Base64 but without confusing characters (0, O, I, l)

---

#### `keys.py` - Identity & Ownership
```python
class PrivateKey:
    """Your secret key - proves ownership"""
    - Generate from random 256-bit number
    - Sign transactions
    - Export as hex or WIF format

class PublicKey:
    """Derived from private key - verifies signatures"""
    - Derive from private key using SECP256k1
    - Verify signatures
    - Generate address
```

**Key Generation Process**:
```
Random 256 bits
    ↓ (ECDSA SECP256k1)
Public Key (512 bits)
    ↓ (SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160)
Hash (160 bits)
    ↓ (Base58Check)
Address (1A1zP1e...)
```

---

#### `transaction.py` - Value Transfer
```python
class Transaction:
    """Transfer of value between addresses"""
    - inputs: List of UTXOs being spent
    - outputs: List of new UTXOs being created
    - signatures: Cryptographic proofs of ownership
    
    Methods:
    - sign_input(): Sign with private key
    - verify_input(): Check signature is valid
    - calculate_hash(): Get transaction ID
```

**Transaction Lifecycle**:
1. **Create**: Specify inputs (what you're spending) and outputs (where it goes)
2. **Sign**: Prove you own the inputs with private key
3. **Broadcast**: Add to pending transaction pool
4. **Mine**: Include in a block
5. **Confirm**: Block added to chain = transaction confirmed

---

#### `block.py` - Transaction Container
```python
class Block:
    """Container for transactions with proof-of-work"""
    - index: Block height in chain
    - transactions: List of transactions
    - previous_hash: Links to previous block
    - merkle_root: Summary of all transactions
    - nonce: Proof-of-work solution
    - timestamp: When block was mined
    
    Methods:
    - mine(): Find valid nonce (proof-of-work)
    - calculate_hash(): Get block hash
    - is_valid_proof(): Check if hash meets difficulty
```

**Merkle Tree**:
```
                Root
               /    \
          Hash01    Hash23
           /  \      /  \
       Hash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3
         |     |     |     |
       TX0   TX1   TX2   TX3
```

**Benefits**:
- Verify any transaction without downloading entire block
- Efficient proof that transaction is in block
- Used by light clients (SPV)

---

#### `blockchain.py` - The Chain
```python
class Blockchain:
    """Manages the entire blockchain"""
    - chain: List of blocks
    - pending_transactions: Waiting to be mined
    - utxo: Unspent outputs (available to spend)
    - difficulty: Mining difficulty
    - halving_interval: Blocks until reward halves
    
    Methods:
    - add_transaction(): Validate and add to pool
    - mine_pending_transactions(): Create new block
    - validate_chain(): Check entire chain is valid
    - get_balance(): Calculate address balance from UTXOs
```

**Validation Rules**:
1. Genesis block is valid
2. Each block's previous_hash matches previous block's hash
3. Each block's hash meets difficulty target
4. All transactions in block are valid
5. No double-spending (each UTXO spent only once)

---

#### `wallet.py` - User Interface
```python
class Wallet:
    """User's interface to blockchain"""
    - private_key: Secret key
    - public_key: Public key
    - address: Public address
    
    Methods:
    - send(): Create and sign transaction
    - get_balance(): Check current balance
    - create_transaction(): Build transaction from UTXOs

class WalletManager:
    """Manage multiple wallets"""
    - Create multiple wallets
    - Track balances
    - Save/load wallet data
```

alice = Wallet()
bob = Wallet()
miner = Wallet()

# Setup blockchain
blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty=4)
blockchain.create_genesis_block(miner.address)

# Miner sends Alice 10 PYC
tx = miner.send(blockchain, alice.address, 10.0)

# Mine the transaction
blockchain.mine_pending_transactions(miner.address)

# Check balances
print(f"Alice: {alice.get_balance_btc(blockchain)} PYC")
print(f"Miner: {miner.get_balance_btc(blockchain)} PYC")
```

### Example 4: Validate Blockchain
```python
# Check if chain is valid
is_valid = blockchain.validate_chain()
print(f"Blockchain valid: {is_valid}")

# Try to tamper with a transaction
blockchain.chain[1].transactions[0].outputs[0].amount = 1000000
is_valid = blockchain.validate_chain()
print(f"Blockchain valid after tampering: {is_valid}")
# Output: False (merkle root won't match!)
```
