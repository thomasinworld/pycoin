## 🎯 What You'll See

### 1. Browser Opens Automatically
The script opens `http://localhost:8000/live_visualize.html` in your default browser.

### 2. Live Indicator
```
🔴 LIVE
```
A blinking red dot shows the demo is running in real-time.

### 3. Current Step Display
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 5: Creating Transaction        │
│ Miner sends 20 PYC to Alice        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Wallet Balances (Updated Live)
```
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│ Alice           │  │ Bob             │  │ Miner           │
│ 1abc...         │  │ 1xyz...         │  │ 1def...         │
│ 20.00000000 PYC │  │ 15.00000000 PYC │  │ 64.99800000 PYC │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

### 5. Blocks Appear One-by-One
```
⛏️ Mining Block #0...
   ↓ (pulse animation)
📦 Block #0 appears
   ↓
⬇ Arrow connects

⛏️ Mining Block #1...
   ↓
📦 Block #1 appears
```

### 6. Transaction Narratives
Each transaction shows a human-readable description:
- **"⛏️ Mining Reward: 50 PYC to 1AUj..."**
- **"📤 Miner sends 20 PYC to Alice"**
- **"📤 Alice sends 5 PYC to Bob"**
- **"📤 Bob sends 10 PYC back to Alice"**

## 🎮 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

### Server
```
🌐 Server running at http://localhost:8000
- Serves HTML files
- Provides API endpoint: /api/state
- Returns blockchain data as JSON
```

### Browser
```
🔄 Polling every 1 second
- Fetches current state from /api/state
- Updates display automatically
- Adds new blocks as they're mined
- Animates everything smoothly
```

### Demo Script
```
📝 Step-by-step execution
- Creates wallets
- Mines blocks
- Creates transactions
- Updates global state
- Provides narratives
```

---

## 📋 Demo Steps in Detail

### Step 1-2: Setup
- Creates Alice, Bob, and Miner wallets
- Initializes blockchain with difficulty 4
- Shows 21M supply cap

### Step 3-4: Genesis Block
- Miner mines the first block
- Receives 50 PYC reward
- Blockchain has 1 block

### Step 5-6: First Transactions
- Miner → Alice: 20 PYC
- Miner → Bob: 15 PYC
- Transactions added to pending pool

### Step 7-8: Mine Block 1
- Mines block with 2 transactions
- Miner gets another 50 PYC reward
- Blockchain has 2 blocks

### Step 9-10: More Transactions
- Alice → Bob: 5 PYC
- Bob → Alice: 10 PYC
- Creating circular flow

### Step 11-12: Mine Block 2
- Mines final block
- Completes the blockchain
- Blockchain has 3 blocks

### Step 13-14: Validation
- Validates entire chain
- Shows final balances
- Demo complete!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Presentations
- Run on a projector/large screen
- The animations help audience follow along
- Transaction narratives make it clear what's happening
- Live updates show the real process

### For Learning
- Watch the step messages carefully
- See how transactions create new blocks
- Notice how balances update after mining
- Understand UTXO model from narratives

### For Development
- Check terminal for detailed output
- Browser console shows API calls (F12)
- Modify timing in live_demo.py (time.sleep values)
- Adjust difficulty for faster/slower mining

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Timing
Edit `live_demo.py` and adjust `time.sleep()` values:
```python
time.sleep(3)  # Wait 3 seconds between steps
time.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds
```

### Change Difficulty
```python
blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty=3)  # Easier = faster
blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty=5)  # Harder = slower
```

### Change Port
```python
def run_server(port=8000):  # Change to any port
```

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Demo

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal:

```
^C
👋 Demo stopped. Thanks for watching!
```

The browser will show the final state. The server stops gracefully.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't open?
Manually visit: `http://localhost:8000/live_visualize.html`

### Port 8000 in use?
Change the port in `live_demo.py` or kill the process:
```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
```

### Not updating?
- Check terminal for errors
- Refresh browser (F5)
- Ensure venv is activated

### Animations not smooth?
- Close other browser tabs
- Use Chrome for best performance
- Check system resources
